# Y.Music_Project

This project is my project in sprint 1, which is Basic Python.

In this project, I learned the key concepts and basic syntax of Python, as well as the Pandas library for data analysis.

# Project Overview

In this project I will act as a Analyst at Y.Music Company, the main goal of this project is to test the hypotheses and compare usersâ€™ preferences. The following is the conclusion that I have drawn after working on the project.

After analyzing the data, we can conclude:
1. User activity in Springfield and Shelbyville depends on the day, even though the cities are different.
    The first hypothesis can be fully accepted.
    
2. Music preferences are not significantly different during the week in Springfield and Shelbyville. We can see a small difference in the ranking on Monday, but both Springfield and Shelbyville, people listen to pop music the most.
    So this hypothesis cannot be accepted. We should also remember that the results may be different if not for the missing values.

3. It turns out that the music preferences of users from Springfield and Shelbyville are very similar.
    The third hypothesis is rejected. If there were differences in preferences, they could not be seen from this data.

Based on the analysis, the marketing team can consider the following recommendations:
1. Since user activity varies depending on the day, the marketing team can plan their campaigns accordingly. For instance, they can run ads on Monday mornings targeting Springfield and Shelbyville residents based on their respective music genres.
2. As pop music is the most preferred genre in both Springfield and Shelbyville, the marketing team can focus on promoting pop music-related products or services in these cities. They can also consider partnering with popular pop music artists to attract more listeners.
